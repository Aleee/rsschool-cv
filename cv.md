### Personal
Currently I work as an emergency department physician and attending cardiologist in one of the hospitals in Minsk, Belarus. While my main passion is definitely medicine, I've always been fascinated by the world of computers. Through my whole career as an economist and later as a doctor I've made many attempts (mostly successful) to facilitate my work by the means of modern computer science. Now when I'm familiar with it, I find more and more in common with medicine. Both require deep envolvment, regular practice, teamwork and - most important - constant learning. Being just an apprenctice in both I know perfectly only one thing: I actually know nothing. This with aforementioned desire to ease every job I do are my primary drivers and reasons for being here.
